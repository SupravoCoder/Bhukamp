# Team Images Directory

## Instructions for Team Member Photos

Please place the team member photos in this directory with the following exact filenames:

### Required Image Files:

1. **suvanjan_das.jpg** - Photo of Suvanjan Das (Lead AI/ML Engineer & Project Lead)
2. **abir_saha.jpg** - Photo of Abir Saha (Seismology Consultant)
3. **arja_banerjee.jpg** - Photo of Arja Banerjee (Full Stack Developer)
4. **sayan_rana.jpg** - Photo of Sayan Rana (Data Scientist)
5. **iqbal_shaikh.jpg** - Photo of Iqbal Shaikh (UI/UX Designer)
6. **supravo_biswas.jpg** - Photo of Supravo Biswas (Research Scientist & Data Analyst)

### Image Requirements:

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or JPEG
- **Size**: Recommended 400x400 pixels or higher (square ratio preferred)
- **Quality**: High resolution for better display
- **Background**: Professional headshot style recommended
- **File Size**: Keep under 5MB per image for faster loading

### Notes:

- If any image is missing, the app will automatically display a placeholder with the person's initials
- Images should be professional headshots or profile photos
- Make sure the filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- You can also use PNG format by updating the file extensions in the code

### Fallback Behavior:

If original images are not available, the system will show:
- Placeholder avatars with initials (e.g., "SD" for Suvanjan Das)
- Color-coded backgrounds matching the app theme
- Professional appearance maintained

To update the image format (e.g., from .jpg to .png), modify the avatar paths in the `Bhukamp_app.py` file in the team_members list.
