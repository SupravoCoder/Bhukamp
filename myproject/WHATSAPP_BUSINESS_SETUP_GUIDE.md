    # Government compliance - audit every message
    def log_government_message(subscriber_id, message_id, delivery_status):
        audit_log = {

            "subscriber_id": subscriber_id,
            "message_id": message_id,

        }
        # Store in government audit database

            "twilio": {"messages_per_second": 100, "daily_limit": 200000}

    def can_send_message(self):
        """Check if we can send a message within rate limits"""
        # Implement rate limiting logic
        return True
